## About Open Educational Materials
KOE focuses on the form of education: so-called Open Educational Materials (OEM). 

OEM can be defined as materials that are shared conform the FAIR principles. 

 - as such OEM are easily findable and reusable, both within and outside of our organization. 

In theory, OEM have merit over Closed EM in:

- sharing
- development
- co-development with colleagues, professionals and students
- transfer of ownership
- updating materials
- re-use (outside of scope)
- licensing (some care in order)

These developments may fortify the position of the UU as a leader in open academia. 

## About You and Me

### Let's start with me
I aim to work as openly as possible. But sometimes I fail.

If you go to my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/gerkovink?tab=repositories), you will find most of my activities in research, education, teaching, development and grant-writing fully open.

<br><br>

### About you
Most of you will recognize the importance of collaborative research and education. 

Many of you may already contribute to open education.

Most initatiatives are still in the grassroots stage.

# Open Education & Materials

## The vision

## But there is more to OE than just M
Many of the conversations about Open Education often circle back to Open Science and FAIR data. 

![](img/fair.png)

Open education can be so much more and may add to a more inclusive and fair educational climate in academia. 

For example, see [this course collaboration page with students](https://github.com/gerkovink/INFOMDA1-2022) for [this course](https://www.gerkovink.com/slv)

Open educational collaboration with colleagues, professionals and students allows for:

1. Easy management of open (source) projects and education
2. Keeping track of fair contributions
3. Empowering early career researchers with visualizing their contributions and impact
4. Demonstrating skill (and lack thereof)


# Our Aim

## What we want to realize

We want to connect developers of OEM into a community of practice that aims to 

1. educate and inform its members about practices and workflows for creating inpiring open educational materials and activities. 
2. fortify the identity of our university
3. incite collaboration and knowledge exchange

## What we plan to deliver

1. A Knowledgecenter Open Education within Social and Behavioural Sciences. 
2. Work together with O&T towards developing a course where educators explore which components in their education would benefit from **open** offering supervision and support for developing such activities. 
3. Explore the legal implications and consequences of sharing an not-sharing open educational materials. 
4. Connect early adopters, grassroots initiatives and passionate colleagues and critics into a resilient network of open education enthousiasts. 

## What we need from you
- Open content. Please give us your thoughts, your courses, your materials, and all your other open activities, such that we can collect them and use them for other people's benefit. 

- Open workflows: How do you generate your open materials. What dissemination means do you use?

- Motivations: Why, when and how do you choose to (not) work open.
